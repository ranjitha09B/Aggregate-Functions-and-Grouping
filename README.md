# Aggregate-Functions-and-Grouping
Let's break down the SQL queries you've provided, explaining each one in detail.

# Selecting all the data in the employees table:
 SELECT * FROM employees;
 This query retrieves all columns and rows from the employees table. It is useful for getting a complete view of the data stored in the table.

# Count of department:
This query counts the number of employees in each department. The GROUP BY clause groups the results by the department column, and the count(department) function counts the number of entries for each department. The result will show each department alongside the number of employees in that department.

# Selecting sum of salary by department:
This query calculates the total salary paid to employees in each department. Similar to the previous query, it groups the results by department, but instead of counting, it sums the SALARY column for each department.

# Count and aggregate functions for a particular department (HR):
This query focuses on the HR department. It counts the number of employees, sums their salaries, and calculates the average salary for that department. The WHERE clause filters the results to include only those employees who belong to the HR department.

# Total salary greater than 150,000:
This query retrieves departments where the total salary exceeds 150,000. The HAVING clause is used to filter groups based on aggregate functions (in this case, Total_salary). It is applied after the GROUP BY clause, allowing you to filter the results based on the aggregated data.

# Summary
The first query retrieves all employee data.
The second and third queries provide counts and total salaries by department.
The fourth query focuses on the HR department, providing counts, total, and average salaries.
The fifth query filters departments based on total salary, showing only those with a total salary greater than 150,000.
These queries are useful for analyzing employee data, understanding departmental structures, and managing payroll effectively.
